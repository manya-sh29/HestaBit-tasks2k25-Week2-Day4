Week 2 – Day 4: JS Utilities + LocalStorage Mini-Project

Practised creating reusable utility functions, debugging with DevTools, and implementing data persistence using LocalStorage. Built a complete Todo App with full CRUD functionality.

LocalStorage operations (save, update, delete, persist on refresh)
Debugging with DevTools (breakpoints, watch variables, call stack)
Error handling using try / catch
Maintaining an error log inside logs/errors.md
Building a Todo App with Add → Edit → Delete → Persist flow
